# Unittest-for-blockchain-class
 This repo is an alternative to using pytest when all else fails.
 It uses python unittest instead and can be used as a starter for writting more 
 unittest and adding them in later.
 
 I also included a setup.py, that would go into the ROOT of your project, if you are having trouble finding modules. 
 The only thing you would have to do, would be to change the "name" variable to your <project's folder name>
