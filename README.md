# Unittest-for-blockchain-class
 This repo is an alternative to using pytest when all else fails.
 It uses python unittest instead and can be used as a starter for writing more 
 unittest and adding them in later.
 To run the suite, navigate to where run_test_suite.py and run it like you would any other python script.
 
 I also included a setup.py, that would go into the ROOT of your project, if you are having trouble finding modules. 
 The only thing you would have to do, would be to change the "name" variable to your <project's folder name>
